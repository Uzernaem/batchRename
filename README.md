# batchRename

Hello, this is a simple script to rename your files according to the date. Just run the script in the parent folder.

It will ask you for tier levels and I added this feature because I filmed on 3 different cameras with 3 very different image qualities so it is for my own organization sake.
Just leave it blank for none (implementing this feature)
